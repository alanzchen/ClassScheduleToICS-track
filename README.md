# ClassScheduleToICS

A Chrome extension to export your class schedule as an ICS file which can be imported into external calenders.

Theoretically, it should work on any system powered by the same software (Oracle Peoplesoft, I suspect), but I currently limit the functionality to CUHKSZ (and CUHK) in the manifest file so the script doesn't run on all websites.

And now, CUHK is also supported.
